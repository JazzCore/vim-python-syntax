# Python-syntax: Enhanced python sytax for vim

This a mirror of [python.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790) made by Dmitry Vasiliev. Since there is no official mirror of syntax file on GitHub i've synced this to the latest version of script.

This comes with additional ``self`` keyword highlighting and with ``python_highlight_all`` option enabled by default.
